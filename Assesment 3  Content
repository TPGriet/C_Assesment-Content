1. At the security checkpoint, airport security personnel have seized a number of traveller's belongings. (N)
Everything has been thrown into a big box (array).
Each product carries a specific level of risk[0,1,2]. 
The risk severity of the items in this case is represented by an array[] of N integer values. 
Sorting the elements in the array according to the degrees of danger is the task at hand. Between 0 and 2 are the risk values.
Example :
Input=
7   (Value of N)
1 0 2 0 1 0 2 (Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line).
Output=
0 0 0 1 1 2 2  (Element after sorting based on risk severity)
TESTCASES:
------------------
case=t1
input=7
0 1 2 0 1 1 2
output=0 0 1 1 1 2 2 

case=t2
Fail message="Guys this is hidden test case.. Check your program correctly to match it!!"
input=8
1 1 0 2 2 1 0 0
output=0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2

                countZero++;
            else if(arr[i]==1)
                countOne++;
